The submission directory contains a directory “corpus” and “storage” the relevant C code files and their compiled executables. Adding text files into the “corpus” directory from “storage” will allow the “main.exe” and “smoothingPoC.exe” programs to create a model based on the files available, these models take some time to build and so including less files in the “corpus” directory will allow them to build significantly faster. “main.exe” takes exactly 1 argument which is the integer value for the length of the n-grams, n must be larger than 2 (as the n-1 model would be worthless!). “tree.exe” must take at least 2 arguments where the first is the item to be searched for and any other input is added as a value to put into the tree.
